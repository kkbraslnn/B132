        Wrapper Class
        Non-primitive data types have "methods" together with the values.
        We can do many actions by using methods which is very useful.
        But primitives do bit have any "methods" because of that we can not do any actions/use methods with primitives.
        Java created "Wrapper Classes" to handle this issue. Java created a new structure which has primitive value and
        methods together.This is called "Wrapper Classes".
        Wrapper Classes are Non-Primitive data types.
